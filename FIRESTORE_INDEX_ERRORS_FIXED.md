# Firestore Index Errors - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary
The application was encountering Firebase Firestore index errors that prevented CRUD operations:

1. **Posts Collection Error**: Query required index for `authorId` (ASC), `createdAt` (DESC), `__name__` (ASC)
2. **Likes Collection Error**: Query required index for `userId` (ASC), `createdAt` (DESC), `__name__` (ASC)

## Root Cause
The application was making compound queries that required composite indexes, but the `firestore.indexes.json` file was missing the required indexes that include the `__name__` field for pagination support.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated firestore.indexes.json
Added the missing composite indexes:

```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "likes",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION", 
  "fields": [
    {"fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING"},
    {"fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING"},
    {"fieldPath": "__name__", "order": "ASCENDING"}
  ]
},
{
  "collectionGroup": "posts",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    {"fieldPath": "authorId", "order": "ASCENDING"},
    {"fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING"}, 
    {"fieldPath": "__name__", "order": "ASCENDING"}
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fixed firebase.json Configuration
Removed the incorrect `"database": "linkup01"` field that was causing deployment issues.

### 3. Deployed Updates
Successfully deployed both:
- `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` ✅
- `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` ✅

## Queries That Are Now Supported

### Posts Queries
- Get posts by author with pagination: `where('authorId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- Get user's own posts with real-time updates
- Posts feed with author filtering

### Likes Queries  
- Get user's liked posts: `where('userId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- Real-time subscription to liked posts
- Like/unlike operations with proper indexing

## Current Index Coverage
The application now has comprehensive indexes for:
- ✅ Posts (visibility + createdAt)
- ✅ Posts (authorId + createdAt) 
- ✅ Posts (authorId + createdAt + __name__)
- ✅ Messages (chatId + timestamp)
- ✅ Notifications (userId + isRead + createdAt)
- ✅ Notifications (userId + createdAt)
- ✅ Chats (participantIds + updatedAt)
- ✅ Stories (authorId + expiresAt)
- ✅ Friend Requests (toUserId + status + createdAt)
- ✅ Friend Requests (fromUserId + status + createdAt)
- ✅ Reports (status + createdAt)
- ✅ Likes (userId + createdAt)
- ✅ Likes (userId + createdAt + __name__)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test post creation and retrieval
2. Test like/unlike functionality
3. Test user profile posts loading
4. Test real-time updates for posts and likes
5. Verify pagination works correctly

## Next Steps
- Monitor application for any additional index requirements
- Consider adding indexes for other query patterns as the app scales
- Regular review of Firebase console for performance insights
