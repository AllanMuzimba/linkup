# üîß Fixed Firebase Setup Guide for React Kubatana

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up Firebase, ensure you have:
- A Google account
- Node.js and pnpm installed
- The React Kubatana project cloned locally

## üî• Step-by-Step Firebase Setup

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., `kubatana-social`)
4. Accept terms and conditions
5. Click "Create project"

### 2. Enable Authentication Methods

1. In Firebase Console, click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Get started"
3. Go to "Sign-in method" tab
4. Enable these providers:
   - Email/Password
   - Google (recommended)
   - Facebook (optional)
   - Twitter (optional)

### 3. Set up Firestore Database

1. In Firebase Console, click "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location near you
5. Click "Enable"

### 4. Set up Cloud Storage

1. In Firebase Console, click "Storage"
2. Click "Get started"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location near you
5. Click "Done"

### 5. Register Web App

1. In Firebase Console, click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è and select "Project settings"
2. Under "Your apps", click the web icon `</>`
3. Register app name (e.g., `kubatana-web`)
4. **DO NOT** check "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
5. Click "Register app"
6. Copy the configuration object - you'll need this for the next step

### 6. Generate Service Account Key

1. In Project Settings, go to "Service accounts" tab
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Click "Generate key" to download the JSON file
4. Save this file securely - you'll need values from it

### 7. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your project root, create a file named `.env.local`
2. Add the following configuration, replacing placeholder values with your actual Firebase config:

```env
# üî• Firebase Web App Configuration
# From Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# üîê Firebase Admin SDK Configuration
# From the service account JSON file you downloaded

FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Replace \n with actual newlines in the private key
# The private key should look like:
# "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-private-key-here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### 8. Format the Private Key Correctly

The private key from the JSON file needs special formatting:

1. Open your service account JSON file
2. Find the `private_key` field
3. Copy the entire value (including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`)
4. Replace all actual newlines with `\n` characters
5. Wrap the entire key in quotes

Example:
```
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### 9. Deploy Security Rules (Optional but Recommended)

Once you're ready for production, deploy stricter security rules:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000

3. Try to register a new account or login

4. Check the browser console for any errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Firebase not initialized" Error

- Check that all environment variables are set correctly in `.env.local`
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in your config values
- Restart your development server after changing environment variables

### Authentication Failures

- Verify that you've enabled the authentication providers in Firebase Console
- Check that your API key is correct
- Make sure you're using the correct project ID

### Firestore/Storage Access Denied

- For development, ensure you're using "test mode" rules
- For production, deploy proper security rules

### Environment Variables Not Loading

- Make sure your file is named `.env.local` (not `.env`)
- Ensure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Restart your development server

## üéØ Next Steps

Once Firebase is properly configured:

1. Test all authentication methods
2. Verify user registration and login
3. Test file uploads to Storage
4. Check real-time data updates in Firestore
5. Implement custom security rules for production

## üÜò Need More Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables match your Firebase project settings
3. Ensure you've enabled all required Firebase services
4. Check that your Firebase project billing is enabled (required for some features)
