# Static Assets 404 Error Fix

## âœ… Issue Resolved: Next.js Static Assets 404 Errors

### Problem
- **Error**: 404 (Not Found) for static chunks:
  - `_next/static/chunks/main-app.js`
  - `_next/static/chunks/app-pages-internals.js`
  - `layout.css`
- **Cause**: Next.js build cache corruption or stale build artifacts

### Root Cause
The Next.js development server had cached build artifacts that were causing conflicts with the updated code, leading to missing static assets.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Stopped Development Server
```bash
taskkill /PID [process_id] /F
```

#### 2. Cleared Next.js Build Cache
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```

#### 3. Cleared NPM Cache
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

#### 4. Restarted Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Result
âœ… **Application now running successfully at: http://localhost:3003**
âœ… All static assets loading properly
âœ… No more 404 errors for Next.js chunks
âœ… Clean build with updated code

### Why This Happened
- Next.js caches build artifacts in the `.next` directory
- When code changes significantly (like our location fixes), cached chunks can become stale
- The development server was serving old cached versions that no longer existed
- Clearing the cache forced a fresh build with current code

### Prevention Tips
- If you encounter similar issues in the future:
  1. Stop the dev server
  2. Delete the `.next` folder
  3. Restart the dev server
- This is a common Next.js development issue when making significant code changes
