## 🗄️ Database Schema - How It Works

### Automatic Collection Creation
**Firestore creates collections automatically** when you first write data to them. No manual setup needed!

### What Gets Created When:

#### 🔐 User Registration
```
users/
└── user_abc123/
    ├── email: "john@example.com"
    ├── name: "John Doe"
    ├── username: "johndoe"
    └── role: "user"
```

#### 📝 First Post
```
posts/
└── post_xyz789/
    ├── authorId: "user_abc123"
    ├── content: "Hello LinkUp!"
    └── type: "text"
```

#### 💬 First Message
```
chats/
└── chat_def456/
    ├── participantIds: ["user1", "user2"]
    └── lastMessage: {...}

messages/
└── message_ghi789/
    ├── chatId: "chat_def456"
    └── content: "Hi there!"
```

### Setup Script Creates:
- ✅ System settings
- ✅ Sample admin user
- ✅ Welcome post
- ✅ Analytics structure
- ✅ Notification templates

**📖 Detailed Explanation**: See `DATABASE_SCHEMA_EXPLANATION.md`
